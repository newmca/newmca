  - Project September is a first person survival horror game revolving around challenging puzzles and immersive interactions. It follows an unnamed protagonist venturing into a long-abandoned secret research complex, uncovering long forgotten secrets.
  - Project Kira is a first person "boomer" shooter set in the far future. It follows a getaway driver named Amba who, in a bid to outrun the law, gets stranded on an uncharted alien planet populated by a peaceful folk enslaved by imperialistic alien race from the darker corners of the galaxy.
